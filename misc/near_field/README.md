The NearField program allows to compute the near-field on an arbitrary (i.e. not related to the voxel grid used for the simulations) set of points, using polarizations stored by ADDA.

Compilation and usage are described in [nearfield_manual.txt](nearfield_manual.txt). 64-bit Windows executables are available in the corresponding [ADDA package](https://github.com/adda-team/adda/releases).
